# SC2 AI

So, you wanted to be a pro gamer, but made a life-typo. All good, friendo.   
Let's put those weathered hands and whetted wits to work and play and slay some nerds, ok?  

This is a Ruby interface for StarCraftÂ® II.  
The game is now available, free to play, at https://starcraft2.blizzard.com.  
This Ruby language is also now available, free to play, at https://www.ruby-lang.org.    

Mac (AppleÂ® silicon / IntelÂ®), MicrosoftÂ© Windows, WSL and LinuxÂ® are all supported. 

You should read this file and then {file:docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md proceed to the tutorials}.

## I am Jack's digital fury
The things we write are called "bots". They beat crap out of each other on https://aiarena.net.  
There are [regular tournaments](https://www.youtube.com/@ProbotsAI) and a permanent live stream here https://www.twitch.tv/aiarenastream.

That's right, you just stumbled upon the final boss of competitive coding. Welcome to Fight Club for Nerds, nerd.  
This is the only door in[.ðŸšª](https://discord.gg/Emm5Ztz)

## Installation
About 5 Steps. Not bad.

### Game + Maps
Download [StarCraftÂ® II](https://starcraft2.blizzard.com) installer and use the default paths.

**Maps**  
After install, download the latest aiarena.net [ladder maps](https://aiarena.net/wiki/maps/#wiki-toc-how-to-install-maps) from the top.  
If they end with ".zip.upload", rename to ".zip".  

Extract them into your install folder + "Maps", i.e.  
Mac: `/Applications/StarCraft II/Maps/`  
Windows: `C:\Program Files (x86)\StarCraft II\Maps\\`  
(Create the folder if it isn't there.)  

Write down one of the map names, we'll use it in a bit when starting a match.

### System Requirements

Oddly, you don't need to know any math to start botting.    
The gem, however, needs some linear algebra for heavy lifting in the form of OpenBLAS and LAPACKE.

**MacOS**  
`brew install openblas`

**Debian/Ubuntu and WSL2**  
`apt install libopenblas0`

**Windows**  
From Command Prompt:  
`ridk enable & pacman -S mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-openblas --noconfirm`

[//]: # (That should be enough for everyone, but if `numo-linalg` complains,   )
[//]: # (then `bundle install --redownload` to rebuild dependencies anew.)

### Get the gem

#### Regarding Ruby versions
If you have any issues with profiling or debugging, Ruby 3.2 runs amazingly.  
Ruby 3.3 performs even better.  
Enabling YJIT is essential as we repeat methods frequently. Pass the runtime arg `--yjit` or `export RUBY_YJIT_ENABLE=1`.  

#### On to the gem

```bash
gem install 'sc2ai'
```

#### Create a new project

Let's create a new bot project folder. Execute from the command line:
```bash
sc2ai new BOTNAME RACE
```

`BOTNAME`: In choosing your botname, remember that this name will be both a class and an executable. No spaces and don't start with a number. Any case is acceptable, `myBot123`, `myBot123`,  `my_bot_123`, etc.   

`RACE`:

- Terran: Human. Tactical, resourceful, harnessing mechanical assault.  
- Zerg: Swarm of alien creatures, overwhelming numbers, biological warfare.  
- Protoss: Advanced alien race, psionic powers, sophisticated technology, honorable warriors.  
- Random: One of the above at random.  

**Example:**
```bash
sc2ai new myCleverBot Terran
```
This creates a bot called `MyCleverBot` in the folder `mycleverbot`.
```bash
cd mycleverbot && bundle install
```

Lets inspect this folder:

| File/Folder          | Notes                                                                                                                      |

| my_clever_bot.rb     | All we actually really need to run.                                                                                        |

| boot.rb              | Ladder: Requires "my_clever_bot" and sets $bot = MyCleverBot.new(...)                                                      |
| .ladderignore        | Ladder: Ignored files when uploading to aiarena                                                                            |
| Gemfile              |                                                                                                                            |
| Gemfile.lock         |                                                                                                                            |

We are almost there, but we need the game client configured.

If you're **not** running Windows, WSL or full Linux, we are ready to launch.
Skip to [Configure StarCraftÂ® II](#label-Configure+StarCraft-C2-AE+II)


### Windows, WSL setup
For pure Windows, you should be fine using the Ruby installer, without additional config, but the SC2 process lifecycle is flakey.

For speed and enjoyment, we recommend installing WSL.
This library was tested under WSL2 (Ubuntu) as WSL1 is too old for anyone to be running it.  

**WSL**  
In this case, SC2 is installed on Windows and your code is executed on Linux.    
To allow the two systems two to talk to each other, open the firewall between them as follows from PowerShell as Admin:   
`New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "WSL" -Direction Inbound  -InterfaceAlias "vEthernet (WSL)"  -Action Allow`  
That should be it for most typical cases. You are ready to launch.

**One exception:** By default the two OS's have the same hostname. We can therefore detect the magic domain of Windows using: hostname + ".mshome.net".  
If you have WSL hostname which _doesn't_ match Windows, setup a custom config either via yaml config.  
Create "sc2ai.yaml" in your project root with your windows host defined.
```yaml
---
host: "WINDOWS-HOSTNAME.mshome.net"
```
... or adding a inline configuration before starting a Match
```ruby
Sc2.config do |config|
    config.host = "MY-WIN-HOSTNAME.mshome.net"
end
```

### Linux, Wine setup
Note: In this scenario is only if you installed SC2 itself on Linux.    
Meaning, the SC2 client you installed is either [headless](https://github.com/Blizzard/s2client-proto#downloads), via Lutris or Wine.

You can manually set your client PATH and the detected PlatForm with environment variables.  
`ENV['SC2PATH']` can be set manually to Starcraft 2 base directory for Linux, if using Lutris. This is the folder which contains the "Versions" folder.  
`ENV['SC2PF']` can and should be manually set to "WineLinux" when running Wine

You can set these in boot.rb or anywhere before launching a Match.  

Additional options which are useful for Linux can be set via {Sc2::Configuration}.

### Configure StarCraftÂ® II

Our competitive ladder plays on v4.10, because there's a Linux client at v4.10 which allows us to play headless.  
The retail game version is way further ahead - currently at v5.0.12 as of this writing.  
  
No worries, all the latest game updates are backported directly into our AI Edition maps (thanks to community effort).
You're free to launch SC2 retail right now, as in the [Running your first Match](#label-Running+your+first+Match) section, but you'll **notice you can't control units manually** or move the camera.

To match the competitive ladder and **gain control locally**, lets download and configure the match runner to launch 4.10 - easy.

#### Method 1 (recommended)
Automatic. From your project directory execute:   
`bundle exec sc2ai setup410`

This launches the client and connects with a special replay file which will handle the downloads.

#### Method 2 - Watch a replay 
Manually download any recent replay from aiarena.net and double click it to watch.  
SC2Switcher will download 4.10 for you.   
Pick any replay here: https://aiarena.net/results/  
Even if it says "Unable to open map", you're ready.

Create "sc2ai.yaml" in your project root with with the `version` set to "4.10"
```yaml
---
version: "4.10"
```
or configure on the fly:
```ruby
Sc2.config do |config|
    config.version = "4.10"
end
```
## Running your first Match

The Hello World of botting is a worker rush.  
Given the example above, lets inspect the created bot file `my_clever_bot.rb`.     

**The Bot:**
```ruby
require "sc2ai"

class MyCleverBot < Sc2::Player::Bot
  def on_step
    if game_loop == 0
      enemy_start_pos = game_info.start_raw.start_locations.first
      units.workers.attack(target: enemy_start_pos)
    end

    # If your attack fails, "good game" and exit
    if units.workers.size.zero?
      action_chat("gg", channel: Api::ActionChat::Channel::Broadcast)
      leave_game
    end
  end
end
```
The `on_step` method executes whenever the game stepped forward. The very first game loop, we send all our workes to attack the enemy's start position.  

**The Match:**  
To run a match, you can simply create a file which includes your bot and executes it the following way:
```ruby
require_relative "my_clever_bot.rb"
Sc2::Match.new(
  players: [
    MyCleverBot.new(name: "myCleverBot", race: Api::Race::Terran),
    Sc2::Player::Computer.new(race: Api::Race::Random, difficulty: Api::Difficulty::VeryEasy)
  ],
  map: "Goldenaura512AIE" # Or any of the downloaded map names
).run

```

One such file is ready-made for you in your project `run_example_match.rb`.  
You can alter this as you see fit and **run the example**:
```bash
bundle exec ruby --yjit run_example_match.rb
```

**Congrats, you're botting!**

**The replay** is auto-saved as `replays/autosave-#{botname}.SC2Replay` for casual review.  

If the code scares you, especially that `game_info.start_raw.start_locations.first` part, fear not.   
The syntax is generally quite friendly while also forcibly teaching you the API.  
We have some extremely useful tutorials ahead once you're done skimming the next two sections.

## Competing on the ladder

Native ruby support for the ladder aiarena.net ladder will follow in 2024.  
Until then, we build a compatible and semi-portable ruby and ship your source code with it. 


### What the process does

We will execute `docker compose` to pull a Ruby linux image, copy your bot directory, `bundle install` and `zip` up what we need.  

**Includes:**  
Everything in your current folder is added, including `data/` where you should store persisted and growing files like databases.  
Then excludes are applied.

**Excludes:**  
 - all dot folders and file (.git .github .bundler)   
 - replays (replays/*)  

You can add additional excludes by adding entries to `.ladderignore`.

### Build a Ladder Zip



**Disclaimers:**  
1. Commit your code before building.  
2. If you have sensitive source in your folder, **review the zip** file before upload.

The build command is `sc2ai ladderzip BOTNAME`, but...

**You must ensure that BOTNAME matches your aiarena "Name" exactly.**  

You are allowed to move and name your classes as you see fit. Your in-game name doesn't even need to match.  
The only important part of the process is that `boot.rb` creates an instance called `$bot` and your built BOTNAME matches you aiarena "Name".

So lets build your bot. Execute this command with your actual BOTNAME instead of myCleverBot:  
```bash
bundle exec sc2ai ladderzip myCleverBot
```

This should generate `./build.zip`.

 
### Uploading

If this is the first time you are creating a bot, the form is here: https://aiarena.net/botupload/  
Upload build.zip to aiarena.net and select "Type" "**cpplinux**".  
You must join a competition for your bot to be scheduled.  
You can also use Request Match to challenge someone directly and immediately.

### Troubleshooting

If you need to debug anything, the logs online are for stderr only. Use it sparingly.  
`$stderr.puts "I really needed this log entry"`

## Practice vs built-in AI
A good practice partner is the built-in AI at `Api::Difficulty` from recommended `Hard` through to `CheatInsane`.  
You can also choose an `ai_build` preset.  
```ruby 
Sc2::Player::Computer.new(difficulty: Api::Difficulty::Hard, ai_build: Api::AIBuild::Air)
```

## Play offline against another bot

To play against yourself or a friend, from the same computer, just setup a multi-bot match.  
Two instances of the game will load.  
```ruby
# require_relative "../friendo/some_other_bot.rb"
class SomeOtherBot < Sc2::Player::Bot
  def on_step; end
end

# Cheating is disabled at network layer on the ladder, but this should help locally:
# module Sc2; class Player; private def perform_debug_commands = clear_debug_command_queue; end; end;

Sc2::Match.new(
  players: [
    MyBot.new(name: "Rubocop", race: Api::Race::Terran),
    SomeOtherBot.new(name: "Jean-ClawsVD", race: Api::Race::Zerg) # :)
  ],
  map: "Goldenaura512AIE",
  
).run

```
## Usage

You've done so excellent thus far, that we should reward you with ending this README. 

I bet you have so many questions about training units, building structures, research and abilities...    
Commanding your army units, making groups and knowing your enemy...  
Info about your resources, supply, reading the minimap, vision, creep and pathing...  
Or even how is ANY OF THIS possible?

Let's go through all of the above in byte sized chunks with the tutorials which follows.
The README is over, but check out [Acknowledgements](#label-Acknowledgements) below which answers one of these questions.

Onwards, {file:docs/QUICK_REFERENCE.md to the tutorials!}
